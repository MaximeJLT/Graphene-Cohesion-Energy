/# Graphene Cohesion Energy Simulation

This project numerically evaluates the **cohesion energy** between a single atom (adatome) and a graphene sheet using the **Lennard-Jones potential**. We explore adsorption energies at three different sites ‚Äî Hole, Top, and Bridge ‚Äî and generate a potential energy surface to visualize atomic migration paths.

## üß≠ Objectives
- Compute interaction energy between a single atom and graphene.
- Identify the most stable adsorption site (Hole, Top, or Bridge).
- Generate 2D and 3D potential energy landscapes.
- Study the potential energy profiles between neighboring sites.

## üß™ Introduction
### What is an Adatom?
An **adatome** is a free atom that adheres temporarily or permanently to a surface. On a graphene lattice, it can adsorb onto different sites depending on the energy landscape.

### Lennard-Jones Potential
The interaction is modeled by the **Lennard-Jones potential**:

$$
V_{LJ} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \frac{B}{r_i^{12}} - \frac{A}{r_i^6} \right)
$$

Where:
- $$r_i$$ is the distance between the adatom and carbon atom $$i$$
- $$N$$ is the number of atoms in the sheet
- $$A = 15.2\ \text{eV},\ B = 24100\ \text{eV}$$ for graphene

- The $$r^{-12}$$ term models electron orbital repulsion
- The $$r^{-6}$$ term models van der Waals attraction

## üìå Adsorption Sites on Graphene
Graphene has a hexagonal lattice with three principal adsorption sites:

- **Hole (H):** Center of a hexagon
- **Top (T):** Directly above a carbon atom
- **Bridge (B):** Midpoint of a C‚ÄìC bond

### Geometric Placement
Using symmetry and lattice constants, the coordinates of the three sites are derived:
- $$d = \frac{pm}{2\cos(\pi/6)}$$ (interatomic distance)
- $$D = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}d$$ (Hole to Bridge)

Coordinates:
- $$X_H = \max(X_s)/2\ ,\ Y_H = \max(Y_s)/2$$
- $$X_T = X_H\ ,\ Y_T = Y_H + d$$
- $$X_B = X_H + D\ ,\ Y_B = Y_H$$

## üíª Pseudocode Summary
1. Build graphene atom coordinates.
2. Define site positions (H, T, B).
3. Compute LJ potential for variable Z-heights.
4. Plot energy vs Z for each site.
5. Generate a colormap at fixed height.
6. Analyze paths between two Hole sites via Top and Bridge.

## üß± Graphene Construction
The graphene sheet is built using two base atoms per cell and translations using primitive vectors. Key parameters include:
- Lattice constant $$pm = 2.47\ \text{√Ö}$$
- 2D coordinates stored in $$R_n$$

Visualization confirms correct geometry and site placement.

## üåç Potential Energy Surface
A colormap is generated at $$Z = 3.38\ \text{√Ö}$$ (Hole equilibrium) over a 2D domain.

- Colors represent potential magnitude
- Darker regions indicate stable adsorption
- Reveals symmetry of hexagonal lattice

Observation:
- Both have same peak energy
- Bridge transition path is **narrower**, hence more favorable
